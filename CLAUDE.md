## Architecture Overview

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite starter template using shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives.

### Core Architecture

**App Entry Point**: `App.tsx` sets up the theme provider and router wrapper using `BrowserRouter` for standard routing.

**Routing**: `Router.tsx` defines routes using React Router v7. All routes are wrapped in `AppLayout` component which provides header, footer, and main content area.

**Layout System**: `AppLayout` component provides the main application shell with responsive design and proper content spacing.

**Theme Management**: `ThemeContext.tsx` provides theme switching (light/dark/system) with localStorage persistence. Theme is applied by adding CSS classes to document root.

**Menu Configuration**: `src/config/menu.ts` - Defines navigation menu items with icons (from Lucide React), titles, and URLs. Menu supports nested items and external links.

### Component Architecture

**UI Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling and class-variance-authority for variant management.

**Layout Components**: `app-header.tsx`, `app-footer.tsx`, `app-sidebar.tsx` provide application shell components.

**Page Components**: Located in `src/pages/` - Feature pages that are routed to. Currently includes Dashboard and Sample pages.

**Tables and Forms**: When adding new tables always use TanStack Table. When adding new forms always use TanStack Form.

### Styling System

Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with custom configuration. The project includes:

- `tailwind-merge` for merging Tailwind classes
- `tailwindcss-animate` for animations
- `clsx` for conditional class application
- CSS custom properties for theme variables

### Build and Deployment

**Development**: Uses Vite with React plugin and Tailwind CSS plugin for fast development.

**Production**: TypeScript compilation followed by Vite build.

### Key Dependencies

- React 19 with TypeScript
- React Router DOM v7 for routing
- Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Vite for build tooling
- Vitest for testing framework
- React Testing Library for component testing

### Environment Variables

- `VITE_APP_NAME` - Application name (fallback: "Sample App")

### Testing Architecture

**Unit Tests**:

- Vitest + React Testing Library for coponent testing
- Unit Test files located in `__tests__/` directories next to source files
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Global unit test configuration with jest-dom matchers
- `src/test/test-utils.tsx` - Custom render function with providers (Router, Theme)

**E2E Tests**:

- Playwright for E2E testing

**Adding / Editiing Component Unit Tests**:

When needing to edit or add new unit tests refer to @.claude/commands/create_unit_tests.md

**Adding / Editing Playwright E2E Test**:

When needing to edit or add new Playwright E2E Tests refer to @.claude/commands/create_e2e_tests.md

Whenever adding new tests that require data from the backend to be mocked, use Mock Service Worker (mswjs.io).

### Adding New Pages

1. Create component in `src/pages/`
2. Add route in `Router.tsx`
3. Add menu item in `src/config/menu.ts` if needed for navigation
4. Create test file in `src/pages/__tests__/` for component testing
5. If the components in the page require data to be fetched from the backend, use Mock Service Worker (mswjs.io) to return sample data.

## Code Style and Structure Guidelines

### TypeScript and React Best Practices

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)

### Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Use early returns for error conditions
  - Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
  - Use custom error types for consistent error handling
- Consider implementing Zod for schema validation when handling complex data structures

### Performance and Optimization

- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading
- Follow performance optimization techniques to reduce load times and improve rendering efficiency

### State Management Recommendations

For applications requiring complex state management beyond React's built-in state, consider:

- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management solution
- **TanStack React Query** - Server state management and data fetching
- Implement proper data fetching patterns with caching and error handling

### Security and Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling and user input validation
- Follow secure coding practices for user data handling
- Validate all external data sources and user inputs
- Use TypeScript's strict mode for enhanced type safety

### Documentation Standards

- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense
- Document component props and their expected types
- Include usage examples for complex components

## Code Formatting

This project uses Prettier for code formatting integrated with ESLint. Prettier is configured to:

- Use single quotes
- Include semicolons
- Use 2-space indentation
- Set print width to 80 characters
- Add trailing commas for ES5 compatibility

You can customize these settings in `.prettierrc.json`.

## Development Methodology

### Approach

1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach problems with analytical rigor. Break down requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.

2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

### Development Process

1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting thorough analysis of the task, considering technical requirements and constraints.

2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines architectural structure and flow of the solution.

3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring each part adheres to specified best practices.

4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform code review, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.

5. **Finalization**: Ensure code meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

## The Development Workflow

1. Make code changes according to the plan
2. Run `npm run format` to format code with Prettier
3. Run `npm run lint` to check code style (includes Prettier formatting check)
4. Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript correctness
5. Run `npm run test:run` and follow the appropriate rule:
   a. If in TDD mode (test-driven development): All tests should pass except for tests that were modified or added for the upcoming change.
   b. If not in TDD mode: All tests should pass.
6. For E2E testing, run `npm run test:e2e` to ensure application works end-to-end
7. Iterate on these steps as necessary.
